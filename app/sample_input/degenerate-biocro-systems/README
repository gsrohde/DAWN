The sample input files in this directory demonstrate edge-case uses of
the BioCro system solver.  Most examples here correspond to one of the
systems described in the appendix of the BioCro article "BioCro as a
Dynamical System", which is available at
https://ebimodeling.github.io/biocro-dev-documentation/master/pkgdown/articles/dynamical_systems.pdf.

Note that none of the examples here uses any differential modules.
Thus, in these examples, the choice of solver is immaterial, and we
may as well simply use the default one.  This allows us to use
dynamical-system rather than simulation-specification as the top level
element in each XML input document: we need only use
simulation-specification as the document element when we want to
specify a solver other than the default one.
