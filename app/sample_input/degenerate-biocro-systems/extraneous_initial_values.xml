<!-- This simulation specification corresponds to the appendix exmaple
labelled "A system having a differential variable but no differential
module" (see the README file in this directory).

That example used a set of drivers having a duration four timesteps
and only a single driver variable called "time".  Here, we instead use
the convenience element "duration" in place of a driver specification.
This will, behind the scenes, generate a driver set having a single
variable "elapsed_time", and again, a duration of four timesteps.
This is a formality only: although we have one driver variable,
elapsed_time, no other variable in the system depends upon its value.

(The case in R is slightly different: in R, either "time" or both of
"doy" and "hour" must be among the driver variables, and the output
will contain all three, with the contraint that time = doy + hour/24
in each row of the output.) -->
