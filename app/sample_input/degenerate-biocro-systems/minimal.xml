<!-- This simulation specification corresponds to the appendix example
labelled "A minimal system" (see the README file in this directory).

Note that in this app, "timestep" is not considered a parameter, but
rather, a property of the drivers.  Thus, there is no "parameters"
element; rather, we use an attribute of "drivers" to specify the
timestep value.

Every XML document representing a BioCro system must have at
least a drivers element with a timestep attribute that directly
contains at least one row element having at least one variable
element.  Alternatively, it can use a duration element in place
of a drivers element (see
minimal_using_duration_element.xml). -->

<dynamical-system>
  <drivers timestep="1">
    <row>
      <variable name="time" value="45.625"/>
    </row>
  </drivers>
</dynamical-system>
