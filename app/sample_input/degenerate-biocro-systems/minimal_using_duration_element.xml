<!-- Unlike the R version of BioCro, in this app we needn't specify
any driver variables if we use a "duration" element.  The "duration"
element is a convenience mechanism for setting up an autonomous
system, that is, a system having no driver input.  This way, we avoid
the tedium of specifying a driver row for each instant of time.  (For
a non-trivial use of the duration element, see the sample input file
"harmonic_oscillator_system.xml", which used to use a cumbersome
drivers element having 629 rather trivial rows.)  Since formally, the
backend C++ library requires at least one driver variable, the app
generates an "elapsed_time" driver variable behind the scenes, whose
value starts at zero and increases by the value of timestep in each
row of the output.

This file is smallest (and most trivial) system-defining XML file we
can write for the app.  Strictly speaking, we shouldn't even require a
timestep attribute when the number of steps, and hence the duration of
the simulation, is zero.  ("timestep" is really only needed if there
is more than one row of output.)  As of this writing, however, the
code is not designed to accomodate this scenario, and so here we give
timestep an arbirary value of 1. -->
