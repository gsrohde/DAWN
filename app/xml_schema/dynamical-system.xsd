          A "real" dynamical system requires at least one differential
          module together with an initial state that sets the initial
          values of all the variables that the differential module
          computes derivatives for.  Formally, however, only some
          variety of "driver-info" element is required--either a
          "drivers" element to set the drivers explicitely within the
          dynamical system element; a "driver-placeholder" element to
          indicate that the drivers will be provided by a separate
          document; or a "duration" element, to indicate that the
          system is autonmous and to specify how many simulation steps
          should be run, and the time interval between steps.

        The selector selects the variable elements within the
        parameters and initial-state elements to ensure no variable
        appears in both groups or more than once in one group.

        If schema validation is turned off, uniqueness of variable
        names is enforce at the program level, but at a later stage.
        The program also ensures that variables in the parameters or
        initial state are distinct from those in the driver rows,
        something that can't easily be enforced by XML schema.
