          The timestep should represent the amount of time that
          elapses between successive steps of a simulation.  As stated
          in the documentation of the drivers element's timestep
          attribute, for nearly all differential BioCro modules, the
          timestep is presumed to be in units of hours.  An important
          exception is the harmonic_oscillator module, which assumes
          that the timestep is given in units of seconds.

          In fact, this exception is especially relevant here, since
          the primary use of the duration element will be to easily
          set up the sort of autonomous dynamical system represented
          by a harmonic oscillator; all "real" BioCro systems (that
          is, those related to biology) will likely use modules
          requiring the use of drivers (in particular, weather-related
          input variables).

          The duration of a simulation using a "duration" element will
          be the timestep (the duration of a single time-step)
          multiplied by number of steps (number-of-steps).

          Using a "duration" element in place of a drivers element
          will generate an elapsed-time variable whose value in the
          last row of the simulation result will equal this duration.
          The elapsed-time variable will, of course, have the same
          units as timestep.

              Within each driver row, no variable should appear more
              than once.

              If schema validation is turned off, this is enforced at
              the program level, but at a later stage.  The program
              also ensures that variables in the parameters or initial
              state are distinct from those in the driver rows,
              something that can't easily be enforced by XML Schema.

              Each row in a drivers element should contain the same
              set of variables, but again, this is enforced at the
              program level and not by this schema.

          The timestep should represent the amount of time that
          elapses between successive rows of the drivers.  In nearly
          all cases, for the variable units to work out to those
          described in the Quantity List for the BioCro Module Library
          (see
          https://ebimodeling.github.io/biocro-dev-documentation/quantity_docs/quantities.html),
          the timestep should be in units of hours.  (But see the
          documentation of the duration element's timestep attribute
          for an exception.)
